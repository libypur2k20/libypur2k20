### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miguel DÃ­az Pestana and I have been a senior programmer in .NET for more than 15 years.

During this time I have worked with Microsoft technologies and products, such as Visual Studio, C #, Linq, SQL Server, T-SQL, WPF, Windows Forms, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, MVVM, MVC, etc.

I am a serious and responsible professional, with the conviction that everything can be improved and that there is always more than one solution for the same problem.

My greatest satisfaction as a programmer is receiving recognition from the client for a job well done.
